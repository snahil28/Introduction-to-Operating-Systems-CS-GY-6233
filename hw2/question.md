## Homework Notes

## General Notes
Read the assignment carefully, including what files to include.
Don't assume limitations unless they are explicitly stated.
Treat provided examples as just that, not exhaustive list of cases that should work.
When in doubt regarding what needs to be done, ask. Another option is test it in the real
UNIX operating system. Does it behaves the same way?
TEST your solutions, make sure they work. It's obvious when you didn't test the code.

## Homework 2 Notes
This assignment does not involve modifying or using xv6 (although the code for
Shell.c is adapted from the xv6 shell).
You should write, compile, a
While it may be tempting to just copy xv6's implementation, there are enough differences
between the xv6 APIs and those in Linux/macOS that doing so would be a bad idea. You
can look at how it works for inspiration though.

## Rubric
Since we had some issues on homework 2. Here are some of the things we know we will test, but
these are not the only things we will test. Therefore make sure to test your program thoroughly
and thoughtfully.
Total: 100 points
Program does not compile (-90)
stdin redirection not working (-30)
stdout redirection not working (-30)
pipe not working (-40)
exec not working (-30)
bad permissions on redirected output (-10)
"not implemented" messages left in (-5)

In this assignment, you will implement pieces of a UNIX shell, and get some familiarity with
some UNIX library calls and the UNIX process model. By the end of the assignment, you will
have a shell that can run complex pipelines of commands, such as:
$ cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep cat | sed s/cat/dog/ >
doggerel.txt
The above pipeline takes /usr/share/dict/words (a file generally installed on UNIX
systems that contains a list of English words), selects out the words containing the string "cat",
and then uses sed to replace "cat" with "dog", so that, for example, "concatenate" becomes
"condogenate". The results are output to "doggerel.txt". (You can find detailed descriptions of
each of the commands in the pipeline by consulting the manual page for the command; e.g.:
"man grep" or "man sed".)
Start by downloading the shell.c skeleton file attached to this homework. You don't have to
understand how the parser works in detail, but you should have a general idea of how the flow of
control works in the program. You will also see the "// your code here" comments, which
is where you will implement the functionality to make the shell actually work.
Next, try to compile the source code to the shell:
$ gcc shell.c -o shell
You can then run and interact with the shell by typing ./shell :
user@cs6233 : ~$ ./shell
cs6233> ls
exec not implemented
cs6233>
Note: The command prompt for our shell is set to cs6233> to make it easy to tell the difference
between it and the Linux/macOS shell. You can quit your shell by typing Control-C or
Control-D.
Problem 1: Command Execution (30 points)
Implement basic command execution by filling in the code inside of the case ' ' blockin the
runcmd function. You will want to look at the manual page for the exec(3) function by typing
"man 3 exec" (Note: throughout this course, when referring to commands that one can look up in
the man pages, we will typically specify the section number in parentheses -- thus, since exec is
found in section 3, we will say exec(3)).
Once this is done, you should be able to use your shell to run single commands, such as
cs6233> ls
cs6233> grep cat /usr/share/dict/words

## Hint:
1. You will notice that there are many variants on exec(3). You should read through the
differences between them, and then choose the one that allows you to run the commands
above -- in particular, pay attention to whether the version of exec you're using requires
you to enter in the full path to the program, or whether it will search the directories in the
PATH environment variable.
Problem 2: I/O Redirection (30 points)
Now extend the shell to handle input and output redirection. Programs will be expecting their
input on standard input and will write to standard output, so you will have to open the file and
then replace standard input or output with that file. As before, the parser already recognizes the
'>' and '<' characters and builds a redircmd structure for you, so you just need to use the
information in that redircmd to open a file and replace standard input or output with it.

## Hints:
1. Look at the dup2(2) and open(2) calls.
2. The file descriptor the program is currently using for input or output is available in
rcmd->fd.
3. If you're confused about where rcmd->fd is coming from, look at the redircmd
function and remember that 0 is standard input, 1 is standard output.
4. Be careful with the open call; in particular, make sure you read about the case when you
pass the O_CREAT flag.
When this is done, you should be able to redirect the input and output of commands:
cs6233> ls > a.txt
cs6233> sort -r < a.txt
Problem 3: Pipes (40 points)
The final task is to add the ability to pipe the output of one command into the input of another.
You will fill out the code for the '|' case of the switch statement in runcmd to do this.

## Hints:
1. The parser provides the left command in pcmd->left and the right command in pcmd-
>right .
2. Look at the fork(2), pipe(2), close(2) and wait(2) calls.
3. If your program just hangs, it may help to know that reads to pipes with no data will
block until all file descriptors referencing the pipe are closed.
4. Note that fork(2) creates an exact copy of the current process. The two process share any
file descriptors that were open at the time the fork occurred. You can get a sense for this
behavior by looking at a small test program like this one:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
int main() {
int filedes;
filedes = open("myfile.txt", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR |
S_IWUSR);
int rv;
rv = fork();
if (rv == 0) {
char msg[] = "Process 1\n";
printf("Hello, I'm in the child, my process ID is
%d\n", getpid());
write(filedes, msg, sizeof(msg));
}
else {
char msg[] = "Process 2\n";
printf("This is the parent process, my process ID is %d
and my child is %d\n", getpid(), rv);
write(filedes, msg, sizeof(msg));
}
close(filedes);
}
If you put that code into a file, compile it, and then run the resulting program, you should
see a result like:
user@cs6233 : ~$ ./a.out
This is the parent process, my process ID is 56968 and my child
is 56969 Hello, I'm in the child, my process ID is 56969
user@cs6233: ~$ cat myfile.txt
Process 2
Process 1
You can see that both the parent and child process both got a copy of "filedes", and that
writes to it from each process went to the same underlying file.
5. You may find it helpful to re-read the first chapter of the xv6 book, which describes in
detail how the xv6 shell works. Note that the code show there will not work as-is -- you
will have to adapt it for the Linux/macOS environment.
Once this is done, you should be able to run a full pipeline:
cs6233> cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep cat | sed s/cat/dog/ >
doggerel.txt
cs6233> grep con < doggerel.txt
